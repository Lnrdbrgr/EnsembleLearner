# Ensemble Learner

This repository introduces an ensemble learner class that will run predictions using various scikit learn models which are themselves handed to an ensemble method. The project was inspired by a kaggle competition conducted at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). The Ensemble Learner class itself stands free and can be used as in the script. The notebook focuses on a real-life example where hotel cancellations are predicted using the ensemble learner.
The current version is build and tested for classification on larger datasets (>1000 observation). Regression problems might be tackled but not guaranteed. Initial model specifications are meant for larger datasets and might not converge on smaller ones.
